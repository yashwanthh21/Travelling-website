    <h2><p >Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</p>
        <p>
            Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>
        <p>
            The ruins of Chichén Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.

            Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017. </p>

    <h1 style="color: rgb(222, 240, 54);text-align: center"> Why Is the CHICHEN ITZA a World Wonder?</h1>
<h2> <p>Chichen Itza is one of the oldest and best-preserved cities of the ancient world. Built around 1,500 years ago in the northern half of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, this ancient site offers a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the many thousands of Mayan people who once lived here, and tells rich stories about the civilizations of the past. It is for these reasons that it made the list of modern-day world wonders by the New7Wonders Foundation in 2001. We look into a handful of the reasons why this ancient spot is so important today, and worthy of its place as one of the seven wonders of the world.
