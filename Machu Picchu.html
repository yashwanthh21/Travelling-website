    <h2><p >
        Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. In reference to the site’s name, for most English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the name is pronounced MAH-choo PEE-choo or MATCH-oo PEAK-choo, in Spanish as [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu], and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].

    <p>Machu Picchu was believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s.[23] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD.Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).</p>
    <p>There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area

    <p>
<h2> Machu Picchu is one of the world’s greatest treasures, a remarkably well-preserved 15th century Inca citadel with special sacred significance.Nestled high in the Andes Mountains above the Peruvian Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu is a rare citadel that dates all the way back to the 15th century. Built by Incas in around 1450, this hidden city was once a grand estate for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti, containing plazas, temples, homes and terraces, built entirely by hand in drystone walls. Thanks to extensive restoration work in the 20th century, there is now enough evidence to reveal what life was like for the Incas, in the place they called Machu Picchu, meaning ‘old peak’ in Quechua. We look through a handful of the reasons why this site attracts millions of tourists every year, and why it is one of the seven modern wonders of the world.<br>
