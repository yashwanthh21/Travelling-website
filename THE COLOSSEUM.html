    <h2><p >The Colosseum  is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name.</p>
<p >The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000;it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
<p > Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.</p>

    <h1 style="color: rgb(166, 247, 16);text-align: center"> Why Is the COLOSSEUM a World Wonder?</h1>
    <p>
<h2>  In 225 BCE, Greek engineer, physicist and writer Philo of Byzantium compiled the famed original Seven Wonders of the World, a list of marvels, or “things to be seen,” across the ancient world. Since that time, many of these incredible artefacts no longer exist. But in 2007 a Swiss Foundation called the New7Wonders made a new list of seven wonders for the modern world. On that list is the Roman Colosseum, an incredible feat of engineering that takes us all the way back to the Roman Empire. Let’s look through the many reasons why the Roman Colosseum remains one of the most fascinating monuments in the history of human civilization.<p>
    1. A Large Part of the Roman Colosseum Still Stands Today<br>2. It Was a Stage for Gladiatorial Fights<br>3. The Roman Colosseum Is a Marvel of Architectural Innovation<br>4. A Status Symbol for Rome<br>5. It Is Still the Largest Amphitheatre in the World
